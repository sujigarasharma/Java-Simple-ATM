ATM SIMULATION SYSTEM MODULES

CREATE PIN: 
An ATM PIN or Personal Identification Number is a 4 digit code that is unique to every account holder’s ATM cum debit card and is provided to ensure that all the cash withdrawals, POS transactions and online transactions are secured. The transactions are complete only when the cardholder enters the correct PIN, reducing the chances of fraudulent transactions.

CASH WITHDRAWAL: 
This module will maintain a cash withdrawal requires converting the holdings of an account, plan, pension, or trust into cash, usually through a sale, while an in-kind withdrawal simply involves taking possession of assets without converting to cash.

CASH DEPOSIT: 
This module will maintain the money you pay into your bank account or savings account. The bank then has a liability to keep the money safely and pay you it back on the terms you have agreed for that account.

1.	Card less Deposit: This module tells us; you can use this machine to instantly credit your account without visiting the branch. The transaction receipt also gives you your updated account balance. 
2.	Deposit using card: This module tells us; a bank deposit card is linked to business accounts and allows for electronic deposits at all ATM machines. Each deposit card has its own pin and all deposits are recorded on your monthly statements.


CHECK ACCOUNT BALANCE: 
This module tells us, an account balance is the amount of money present in a financial repository, such as a savings or checking account, at any given moment. An account balance that falls below zero represents a net debt


PIN CHANGE: 
This module explains that, PIN is a numeric password for use at the ATM. The PIN is separately mailed / handed over to the customer by the bank while issuing the ATM-cum-debit card. It has to be reset to a new PIN by the customer. Most banks force customers to change the PIN on the first use.


STATEMENT: 
This module explains about the Mini Statement which is a compressed form of the bank account statement in which you can find the details of the last transactions that happened in your bank account. When you open a bank account with any of the banks that are running their operations you will come across the term statement several times.
